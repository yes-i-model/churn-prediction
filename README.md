CustomerChurn Prediction Model
-------------
This project implements a machine learning model using Python's scikit-learn library to predict customer churn in on a hypothetical social media platform. The model utilizes historical data on customer interactions, behavior, and demographics to identify patterns associated with churn. It employs logistic regression for binary classification and evaluates its performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. The project includes data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and one-hot encoding of categorical variables. Feature scaling is also applied to improve model performance. The "read me" file provides insights into how the model can be deployed in a production environment to make real-time predictions, aiding businesses in identifying customers at risk of churning and enabling proactive retention strategies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and maintenance to ensure the model stays up-to-date and accurate as customer behaviors evolve. The Customer Churn Prediction model offers valuable applications for businesses seeking to optimize customer retention and enhance overall sustainability and growth.
